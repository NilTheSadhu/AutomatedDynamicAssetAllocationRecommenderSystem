# AutomatedDynamicAssetAllocationRecommenderSystem


This repository contains the code and mode files for our ADAA Recommender System project for Adv. Big Data and AI with Professor Lin.
Note that many of the ML code files contain multiple models. A save statement has been placed after the models that are kept for the final RL model inputs.
